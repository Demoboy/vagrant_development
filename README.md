# Symfony <--> Vagrant

Boilerplate which sets up a simple development environment with Vagrant, then sets up composer for Symfony and a couple of recommended tools.

## Setup:

1. Run:
`curl -L https://goo.gl/AYUUmz > /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh new_project`

2. Navigate to the `new_project` directory.

3. Coming soon.

## Usage:

You can also run the script from anywhere if you just download (or echo it) and pass a folder name to it, e.g:

`vagrant_development/install.sh new_project`
